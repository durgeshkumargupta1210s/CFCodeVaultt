Penguins are civilized creatures that communicate using permutations. Blackslex, as a penguin researcher, must study their means of communication.

For a given integer n, consider permutations^{\text{∗}} p of the array [0, 1, \ldots, 2^n - 1]. Define S(p) \;=\; \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \operatorname{popcount}\!\bigl(p_0 \mathbin{\&} p_1 \mathbin{\&} \cdots \mathbin{\&} p_i\bigr), where \operatorname{popcount}(z) is the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of z (for instance, \operatorname{popcount}(5) = 2 because 5 = 101_2 has two 1-bits in the binary representation), and \& denotes the bitwise AND operation. .

A permutation is considered sacred if it maximizes S(p). Find the lexicographically minimal^{\text{†}} sacred permutation.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).^{\text{†}}An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b of the same size if and only if the following holds: 

  in the first position where a and b differ, the array a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b. 

 

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 16) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 16).

It is guaranteed that the sum of 2^n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{16}.

Output:
For each test case, output 2^n integers p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{2^n-1} — the required permutation.

Example:
Input:
2

1

2

Output:
1 0 

3 1 0 2 

Note:
For the first test case, there are two possible permutations.

  p = [0, 1], S(p) = 0 

 p = [1, 0], S(p) = 1 

For the second test case, S([3, 1, 0, 2]) = 3 is sacred. There are other permutations p that are sacred, such as p = [3, 2, 0, 1], but those are not lexicographically minimal.
