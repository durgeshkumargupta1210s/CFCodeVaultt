Blackslex worked too hard and started dreaming about numbers. Solve the following task from his dreams.

You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.

In one operation you choose an index i (1 \le i \le n) and an integer x which is at least k and set  a_i := a_i \bmod x,  where u \bmod v denotes the remainder of dividing u by v.

Your goal is to make all elements of the array identical. Among all positive integers k, determine the maximum k for which there exists a finite sequence of the above operations that makes all array elements equal.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9, all values of a are distinct).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum positive integer k such that it is possible to make all elements of the array identical using any number of operations with moduli x restricted to k \le x.

Example:
