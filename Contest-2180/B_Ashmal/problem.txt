You have an array a of n strings a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, each consisting of lowercase English letters, and an empty string s.

In the i-th (1 \le i \le n) step, you should do one of the following: 

  add a_{i} to the beginning of s, or 

 add a_{i} to the end of s. 

For example, if before the i-th step s = \mathtt{aba} and a_{i} = \mathtt{bba}, after the i-th step, s will be equal to \mathtt{ababba} or \mathtt{bbaaba}.

What's the lexicographically smallest string s you can reach after n steps?

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b of the same length, if and only if the following holds: 

  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 500). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 1000) — size of array a. The next line contains n strings a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n} (1 \le |a_i| \le 4000), each consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000, and the total length of all strings in the input (over all test cases) does not exceed 4000.

Output:
For each test case, print the lexicographically minimum string s you can reach after n steps.

Example:
Input:
3
4
amir rima amin nima
1
codeforces
3
a ab abc

Output:
aminamirrimanima
codeforces
aababc

Note:
In the first test case, one possible way to construct the lexicographically minimum string s is as follows:

  After the first step, s = \mathtt{amir} regardless of whether we add it to the beginning or the end, since s was initially empty. 

 In the second step, we add a_2 = \mathtt{rima} to the end of s. Now s = \mathtt{amirrima}. 

 In the third step, we add a_3 = \mathtt{amin} to the beginning of s. Now s = \mathtt{aminamirrima}. 

 In the last step, we add a_4 = \mathtt{nima} to the end of s. Therefore, the final value of s is \mathtt{aminamirrimanima}. 

It can be proven that this resulting string is indeed the lexicographically smallest string obtainable after all steps.
