I've always loved the word magic. It has a way of making people happy, of putting a smile on their faces.

Anis and her new assistant Euphie are improving the Witch's Broom! Magicology requires great precision and care — in order to fly, the construction of the broom must have sufficiently few imperfections.

For an arbitrary array a of length m, call an index i (1\leq i\leq m-2) bad if a_i, a_{i+1}, and a_{i+2} are all pairwise coprime. More formally, i is a bad index if and only if \gcd(a_i, a_{i+1}) = \gcd(a_i, a_{i+2}) = \gcd(a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}) = 1^{\text{∗}}. Furthermore, call a good if it has at most 6 bad indices.

You are given an integer n. Construct a good permutation^{\text{†}} p of length n. It can be shown that such a permutation always exists.

Note:
that you do not have to minimize the number of bad indices.^{\text{∗}}\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor of x and y^{\text{†}} A permutation of length n is an array that contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, in any order.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4)  — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (3\leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, output on a single line n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n, an example of a good permutation of length n. If there are multiple good permutations, you may output any of them.

Example:
Input:
4

3

6

8

9

Output:
2 1 3
4 1 6 3 5 2
4 1 6 3 5 2 8 7
5 4 8 1 9 3 6 2 7

Note:
For n=9, we have 

ip_ip_{i+1}p_{i+2}\gcd(p_i, p_{i+1})\gcd(p_i, p_{i+2})\gcd(p_{i+1}, p_{i+2})1548114248141138191114193113593633363623127627211

The only bad index is 3. Since 1\leq 6, p$$$ is a good permutation.
