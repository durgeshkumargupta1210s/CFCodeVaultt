"What a pain..."

— Hougetsu Shimamura

Adachi is in the middle of a generational crashout... over, uh, this problem! Yep, that's definitely it... anyways, please help her solve it!

You are given two arrays a and b of length n (1\leq a_i\leq b_i).

In one operation, you may either: 

  choose an index i (1\leq i\leq n) and set a_i := a_i + 1, or 

 double all elements of a. 

Let x denote the minimum number of operations needed to make a = b. Two arrays a and b of length n are considered equal if a_i = b_i for all 1\leq i\leq n.

Find the value of x. Additionally, count the number of sequences of operations that make a = b using exactly x operations. Two such sequences of operations are considered different if, for any 1\leq j\leq x, the j-th operation of each sequence differs (either in the type of operation selected or the index chosen, if applicable).

Since the number of sequences may be large, output it modulo {\color{red}{10^6+3}}. 

Note:
that 10^6+3 is a prime number.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^4)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 2\cdot 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains n integers, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1\leq a_i\leq 10^6).

The third line of each test case contains n integers, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (a_i\leq b_i\leq 10^6).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, output two integers, the value of x, and the number of sequences of operations that make a = b using exactly x operations, modulo 10^6+3. The value of x should be printed exactly; that is, it should not be taken modulo 10^6 + 3.

Note:
In the second sample, it is possible to convert a into b using only three operations. There is only one way to do so, namely: 

  Add 1 to a_1, yielding a = [2, 1]. Then double all elements of a, yielding a = [4, 2]. Then add 1 to a_2, yielding a = [4, 3]. Then we have that a = b, as desired. 

It can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b using fewer than three operations.
