You start with an integer array a, which initially consists of n zeros. You have to perform the following action exactly n times:

  choose two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n) and assign a_{i} = a_{i} + 1 for each i such that l \le i \le r. 

You are given an array b, consisting of n integers. Your task is to choose such values l and r for each action that: 

  after all n actions are performed, it's possible to reorder the elements in such a way that a becomes equal to b; 

 the maximum value of r - l + 1 over all actions is as large as possible. 

What's the maximum possible value of r - l + 1?

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}) — the length of the array b.

The second line of each test case contains n integers b_{i} (0 \le b_{i} \le n) — the elements of the array b.

Additional constraints on the input: 

  there exists at least one way to choose l and r for each action and reorder the elements at the end so that a becomes equal to b; 

 the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. 

Output:
For each test case, output one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example:
Input:
3

5

0 5 1 0 1

3

3 2 1

5

1 1 1 1 1

Output:
3

3

1

Note:
Consider the first test case. If the n actions were as follows:

  l = 3 and r = 3 

 l = 1 and r = 3 

 l = 3 and r = 3 

 l = 3 and r = 3 

 l = 3 and r = 3 

The array a = [1, 1, 5, 0, 0], so you can reorder the elements to make it equal to [0, 5, 1, 0, 1]. As can be seen in this case, the maximum value of r - l + 1 is 3. It can be shown that this is the optimal answer.

In the second test case:

  l = 1 and r = 3 

 l = 2 and r = 3 

 l = 3 and r = 3 

The answer is 3.
